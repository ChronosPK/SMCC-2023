## Intro:

I came by this institution a few months ago. <br/>
I had to get a break because I was out of gas and had some time to admire the view and the buildings. <br/>
The gas prices weren't that high, but every time I see them I think about buying an electric car. <br/>

Anyway... I hope the kids in these institutions are doing well, can't imagine how it is to be there so much. <br/>

Anyway, if you think you can extract a flag out of this hole thing, go for it. <br/>

Flag format is `flag{.*?}`
