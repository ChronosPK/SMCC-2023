## Intro:

I came by this institution a few months ago in one of my trips. <br/>
Since I had to go to a gas stop, I was also able to admire the view and the buildings. <br/>
Even though the prices weren't that high compared to what I was used back home, I still found them quite surprising. <br/>
Anyway... I hope the kids in these institutions are doing well, can't imagine how it is to be there so much. <br/>
<br/>
If you think you can *extract* a flag out of this hole thing, go for it. <br/>

Flag format is `flag{.*?}`
