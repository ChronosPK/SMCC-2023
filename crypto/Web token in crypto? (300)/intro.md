## Intro:
My friend sent me this string. <br/>
He said it was a token for a website, but I don't think he knows what a token looks like. <br/>

He said it is not valid and that I should help him find the secret signature...<br/>
Yeah, whatever. I don't really care for it. Can you do it though? <br/>

Flag format: `flag{secret}`
