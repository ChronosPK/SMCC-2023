## Intro:

POV: You are a junior pentester. 
<br><br>
A senior is assessing a pentest for a private company. <br>
He managed to retrieve names and passwords and he wants you to check which set of credentials is correct. <br>
You can verify if you have the right credentials in the form **`username:password`**. <br>

<br>

This is the username format: <br>
**`employee.last-name.first-name`** <br>
(lowercase letters, "`employee`" is standard)

<br>

Let's try to automate this nicely and get the **`flag{username:password}`**

<br>
Note: Don't forget to ask google everything you don't know. <br>
It will show you how to create everything. <br>
Also, a good resource for explanations is https://stackoverflow.com.
