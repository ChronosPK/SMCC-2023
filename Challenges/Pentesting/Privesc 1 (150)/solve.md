## Solve:

Looking at the `C` code, we see that the `bash` command doesn't use the full **`PATH`** of the `ping` command. <br><br>
This means that an attacker can create his own script that has the same name (`ping`), but can have a reverse shell inside. <br>
Also, the attacker needs to export the path variable to call the location of the new script first, so that the system will execute it instead of the normal `ping` executable.

## Flag:
**`flag{path}`**
