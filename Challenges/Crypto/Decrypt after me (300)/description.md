## Intro:

#### Decrypt after me:
1. Decrypt the file `first.txt.openssl` with the key `password123`. You should know the following: <br>
    - I encrypted it with `aes-256-cbc`
    - I also used `Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2`
    - I iterated the encryption `10000` times
1. Decrypt the file `second.txt.gpg` with the key `tryharder`. You should also know the following: <br>
    - the algorithm used is **aes256**
