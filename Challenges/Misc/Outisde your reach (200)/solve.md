## Solve:

- Intro points out to "outside" and "undo"
- Second slide, when viewed in presentation mode, has an animation on the man in mask
  - if you do a reverse image search, you will see it is from "CROPP", which makes you think of "cropping and image"
  - if yuo didn't see that, there is still a message saying "here" under the image with MrRobot
- If you select the cropping tool, you see the image was originally larger, and on the extremities the flag was hidden. <br> <br>
