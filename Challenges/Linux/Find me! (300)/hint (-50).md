## Hint:
You need to automate this. <br>
Let me teach you some linux-fu. <br>

<br>

- [ ] For loop:<br>
  ```bash
  for i in <condition here>; do <command here>; done
  ```
  i.e.: `for i in {1..10}; do echo $i; done`
  - `{1..10}` -> sequence of numbers from 1 to 10
  - `$i` -> calling a variable

- [ ] Check manual of commands:
  `man zip` # or google 

- [ ] Extract lines that contain a string of characters we want:
  `grep `

- [ ] Cut words:
  `cut`
