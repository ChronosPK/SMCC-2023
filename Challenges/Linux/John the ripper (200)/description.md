## Intro:

I just found this archive on the desktop of a social engineering victim. <br>
Some other sources point out this holds important credentials. <br>
I need your help to crack the password of this archive so I can try to pivot through the machine. <br>
Do you think you can do it? <br>

Flag format: **`flag{password}`**
