## Hint:

### SSH 
- Secure Shell - encrypted communication across networks
- it gives you a "shell" (command prompt - you can execute commands)

<br>
You normally should be capable of executing commands. <br>
But, in this scenario some things have been modified and replaced. <br>

The best hint I can give you is already the first thing you saw at this challenge.
