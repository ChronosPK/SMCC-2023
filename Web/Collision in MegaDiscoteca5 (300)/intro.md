## Intro:

Last summer I went in MegaDiscoteca5 and <br/>
I saw how a fight broke out. <br/>
2 guys that were nothing alike started pushing eachother <br/>
because they both wanted the same girl. <br/>
The first one was tall and skinny, <br/>
and the other one was shorter and chunky. <br/>
<br/>
Next thing you know, punches start colliding. <br/>

<br/>

I don't care who came on top, just how could they start it being so different (yet so similar). <br/>
