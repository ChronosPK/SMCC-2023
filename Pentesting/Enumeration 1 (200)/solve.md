## Solve:

1. Is anonymous mode enabled by default for FTP servers?
2. You insert `'or 1=1 -- - ` in a login page in the password field and you are logged in. Is this an XSS web attack?
3. Do ports 22, 25, 80, 443 and 3306 represent the services SSH, SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS and MySQL?
4. Does SSH use asymmetric encryption and supports both password and private key authentication?
5. Can we use the `ftp` command for banner grabbing to enumerate general services? 

1. no 
2. no - SQL injection
3. yes
4. yes
5. no - we use `nc` for banner grabbing
