Don't use full paths for your scripts.

Why? 
- portability - full paths are tied to a specific file strcuture on a particular machine
- maintability - if your project evolves, those static paths will become very inconvenient
- collaboration - you can't collaborate with others if you use paths that only fit your system

This folder is called "deprecated" because I modified all the other files to fit other systems.<br>
I decided to keep a part of the old version to showcase the evolution of the project and the good practices.

I hope you can all learn something new from this project. Good luck!
